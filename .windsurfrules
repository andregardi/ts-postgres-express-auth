Every time you choose to apply a rule(s), explicitly state the rule(s) in the output. You can abbreviate the rule description to a single word or phrase.

### 1. Database (Drizzle)

-   Always use Drizzle ORM for database operations.
-   When creating tables:
    -   Create new schema files in `src/db/schema`.
    -   Ensure new schema files are correctly exported and included in `src/db/schema/index.ts`.
-   Use the following commands for migrations (as per [package.json](cci:7://file:///Users/andregardi/projects/list/server/package.json:0:0-0:0)):
    -   `npm run db:generate` - Create new migration file (equivalent to `drizzle-kit generate`).
    -   `npm run db:push` - Push migrations to the database (equivalent to `drizzle-kit push`).

### 2. File Naming

-   Use **kebab-case** for all folder and file names (e.g., `user-controller.ts`, `auth-routes`).
-   Never use uppercase letters in file or folder names.
-   Use **camelCase** for variables and function names in code (e.g., `getUserById`, `const itemCount`).

### 3. Routing

-   All route definitions must reside in the `src/routes` directory.
-   Route files should be named simply and reflect the resource they manage (e.g., `items.ts` for item-related routes, not `items-route.ts`).
-   For routes requiring authentication:
    -   Apply the `requireAuth` middleware located in `src/middlewares/auth.ts`.

### 4. Logic Separation

-   Keep route handler files (`src/routes/*`) lean and focused on request/response handling.
-   Delegate complex business logic to controller files located in `src/controllers`.
-   Controller files should be named simply, corresponding to the resource or feature area (e.g., `items.ts` for item-related logic, not `items-controller.ts`).

### 5. Services

-   Service files are to be placed in `src/services`.
-   Services should encapsulate logic for interacting with **external APIs only**.
-   Create new service files as needed.
-   Service files should have simple names reflecting the external service they interact with (e.g., `payment-service.ts`, `notification-service.ts`).

### 6. Code Style & Quality

-   Prioritize clear, readable, and maintainable code over overly concise or "clever" one-liners.
-   Add comments to explain complex logic, non-obvious decisions, or workarounds.
-   Follow established patterns and conventions within the existing codebase.
-   Adhere to the **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)** principle in all code and text. Review files with this in mind.
-   **Certainty**: Verify information and cross-check sources before making definitive statements or implementing critical logic. Leverage the ability to inspect the entire repository.

### 7. Project Setup & Configuration
- Maintain a `.env.example` file in the root directory, listing all required environment variables with placeholder or example values. **Never commit the actual `.env` file.**
- **TypeScript Best Practices**:
    - Strive to use specific types instead of `any` whenever possible to leverage TypeScript's static typing benefits.
    - Utilize TypeScript features like interfaces, enums, and utility types to create robust and self-documenting code.
